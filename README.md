# Shortify

Shortify is a modern URL shortening service built with Next.js and TypeScript.
It allows both anonymous and registered users to shorten long URLs efficiently.
Registered users gain access to a personalized dashboard where they can manage their shortened links and track basic statistics like total clicks.

This project leverages Next.js App Router to handle both frontend and backend (API) logic in a single monorepo — no separate backend service is required.
